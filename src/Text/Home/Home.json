I also got my first hands-on experience with React U.I. framework, Spring/Springboot (Java) for back-end web-development.\n\n I was faced with a pretty difficult challenge, to quickly learn the Spring framework. This was a huge challenge that I overcame. I had Java experience going into the job but had to learn Spring from scratch. I achieved this through reading the documentation online, YouTube videos and online web-forums."

I learned the essentials of communication and got a taste for consultancy and project-management. \n\nThis was during the midst of the pandemic in 2020 and yet they were still equipped to carry out the internship virtually and it wasn't cancelled, as many of us feared. I am massively grateful to have been selected for the program. This program involved a lot of learning and collaboration sessions. I also shadowed my team-mates and learned from them. I improved my communication, listening and team-working skills."
